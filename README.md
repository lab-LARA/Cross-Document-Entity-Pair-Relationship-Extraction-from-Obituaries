# Cross-Document-Entity-Pair-Relationship-Extraction-from-Obituaries
This project extracts named entities, relationships, and metadata from obituary data to build a knowledge graph using GPT-4o and Neo4j. It enables efficient retrieval, visualization, and inference of relationships across documents, addressing challenges like varied formats and ambiguities in unstructured text.

1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.8+
Neo4j Community Edition (or Enterprise Edition)
Required Python libraries (install via requirements.txt)

2. Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd Cross-Document-Knowledge-Graph

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up a Neo4j instance:
Open Neo4j Cloud Aura and start the database server.
Create a new database and configure your credentials in the config directory.


Usage
1. Extract Data
Run the following scripts to process obituary text and extract information:
Named Entity Recognition:
python scripts/ner_extraction.py

Relationship Extraction:
python scripts/relation_extraction.py

Metadata Extraction:
python scripts/metadata_extraction.py
The outputs will be saved in the data/outputs directory as JSON files.

2. Build the Knowledge Graph
Once the data is extracted, construct the graph using:
python scripts/graph_builder.py

3. Update the Graph
To add new data or update existing relationships:
python scripts/graph_updater.py

4. Visualize the Knowledge Graph
Access the Neo4j browser and run Cypher queries to explore the graph:

Cypher query to visualize the Knowledge graph :
MATCH (a:Person)-[r]->(b:Person) RETURN a, r, b;

Key Scripts
ner_extraction.py: Extracts entities like names and places from obituary text.
relation_extraction.py: Identifies relationships such as Parent, Spouse, and Sibling.
metadata_extraction.py: Retrieves metadata (e.g., birth and death details) from the text.
graph_builder.py: Constructs the Neo4j knowledge graph from extracted data.
graph_updater.py: Updates the Neo4j graph with new or modified nodes and relationships.
api_helper.py: Provides helper functions for interacting with external APIs.


Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Neo4j: Graph database for managing relationships.
OpenAI GPT: For extracting data with three shot prompting.
Cypher: Query language for Neo4j.
JSON: Data format for structured processing.
